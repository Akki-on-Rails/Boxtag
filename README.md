# BoxTag

Store it, find it!
You have loads of things all stored in boxes in different places? With BoxTag you can manage your stuff easily. Don't search for things - find them!

With this PWA you're able to manage boxes and their insides. No matter if you want to tidy up your attic or if you want to move house and need to organize all the helpers. In BoxTag you create collections (can be events or places) where you put all the boxes and their insides.
Print out QR codes to label the boxes. By scanning the code you're able to see what's in the box without opening it. The app's search function enables you to find items and their containing boxes.
Also you can share your collections with others e.g. when moving house all your helpers can scan the boxes and see, where to put it.
